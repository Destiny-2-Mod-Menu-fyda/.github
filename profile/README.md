## ⚙️ How To Use a Mod Menu in Destiny 2

> ⚠️ For educational/experimental use only. PvP usage risks bans.

1. **Install a Private Loader** – Many cheat providers offer custom loaders for Destiny 2 (external or internal injectors).
2. **Enable Stealth Mode** – Use HWID spoofers, BattlEye bypass, and stream-proof overlays to avoid bans.
3. **Launch Destiny 2**, then inject the mod menu.
4. Use hotkeys like:

   * `F1` – God Mode
   * `F2` – Infinite Ammo
   * `F3` – Aimbot
   * `F4` – ESP Toggle
   * `F5` – Teleport

Mod menus often include full GUI panels with sliders, toggle switches, and keybinding systems. 🔧

## 🛡️ Staying Safe with Anti-Cheat

Destiny 2 uses **BattlEye**, so don’t get reckless:

* Use **private or custom lobbies** for mod testing
* Avoid public matchmaking when using rage features
* Use **spoofers** and rotate loader builds
* Never leave mod menus running when streaming 🎥
